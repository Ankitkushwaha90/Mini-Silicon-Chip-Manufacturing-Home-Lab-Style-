# Semiconductor Chip Supply Chain Overview

## Taiwan's Role in Silicon Chip Manufacturing

Taiwan is a global leader in semiconductor manufacturing, primarily due to:

### 1. TSMC (Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company)

* World's **largest contract chipmaker** (makes chips for Apple, AMD, Nvidia, etc.).
* Specializes in **advanced nodes** like 5nm, 3nm, etc.
* TSMC **does not design chips**, only **fabricates** them based on others' designs.

### 2. UMC (United Microelectronics Corporation)

* Another large Taiwanese foundry.
* Focuses on more mature process nodes (28nm, 45nm, etc.).

### 3. ASE Group

* World’s largest semiconductor **assembly and testing** company.

**Summary**: Taiwan companies mostly **fabricate and package chips**, not design them.

## U.S. Efforts in Chip Manufacturing

Due to global supply chain concerns and geopolitical risks, the U.S. is investing in domestic semiconductor production:

### 1. Intel

* Building new fabs in **Arizona and Ohio**.
* Focused on high-performance chips.
* Competes with TSMC.

### 2. TSMC Arizona Fab

* Building a \$40B+ fab in Arizona.
* Will produce **5nm and 3nm** chips for Apple, AMD, etc.

### 3. Samsung Texas Fab

* Investing \$17B+ for a fab in Taylor, Texas.

### 4. Micron

* Expanding DRAM/NAND production in **Idaho and New York**.

**Summary**: The U.S. is focused on rebuilding its **chip manufacturing infrastructure** with help from companies like Intel, TSMC, Samsung, and Micron.

### Stages:

1. **Chip Design** – Logic and architecture of the chip (often done in the U.S.).
2. **Fabrication** – Wafers manufactured in foundries (TSMC, Intel).
3. **Packaging** – Chips are assembled into usable forms.
4. **Customer** – Shipped to companies like Apple, Dell, etc.
